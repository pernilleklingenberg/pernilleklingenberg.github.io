                <h2>For those frustrated with vaccine system, a crew of volunteers is ready to help</h2>
                <p>As the scramble for scarce vaccines intensifies, a band of volunteers has stepped in to accomplish the task that has defeated so many: making an appointment to get a COVID-19 shot.

Massachusetts COVID Vaccination Help, as this posse of mostly young women is called, launched on Feb. 20, and claims to have landed appointments for 450 people as of Monday, through a combination of technological know-how and persistence. And they did it all for free.

But hundreds more are waiting in line for help, a sign of how difficult the process has proven to be.

“The volume of the demand and desperation is incredible,” the group’s founder, Diana Rastegayeva, said by phone, as her 3-month-old cooed in the background. She’s on maternity leave from her job as chief of staff at a cancer genomics company. The whole thing started, in fact, among participants in a Facebook group for new mothers. The volunteers are mostly between the ages of 20 and 40, but they include some older people, some men, and even a high school senior. They volunteer when their babies nap, or before and after work-from-home jobs or classes. About 275 people have offered to help but not all have started.

                <h2>State officials, community leaders try to dissuade residents from vaccine ‘shopping’</h2>
                <p>
With a third COVID-19 vaccine soon to be available in Massachusetts, state officials and community leaders Monday sought to discourage residents from “shopping” for one brand over another, stressing that all are highly protective against serious disease from the coronavirus.

The assurances stemmed from apparent concern the newly authorized Johnson & Johnson vaccine, a one-shot formula officials view as ideal for hard-to-reach populations, might be regarded as an inferior product — especially by marginalized communities distrustful of the health care system.

“People don’t need to pick one from another,” Governor Charlie Baker said after touring a vaccination site at Morning Star Baptist Church in Mattapan on Monday morning. “People should get vaccinated. If you have a chance to get a vaccine, you should take it — whatever it is.”

The governor’s remarks were echoed by Bishop John M. Borders III, the church’s senior pastor, who said his parishioners wouldn’t be “picking or choosing what company they’re going to receive the vaccination” from. Church and community leaders in high-risk communities, such as Mattapan, have been working to counter vaccine hesitancy and misinformation about the shots being offered. “All of these vaccinations keep people out of the hospital,” Borders said. “They keep people from being sick for a long period of time. Anyone coming here at Morning Star will not be asking ‘what vaccination product will you be using.’”

The new vaccine was only one part of the state’s fast-changing COVID-19 response Monday, as Baker also defended his decision to move forward with a reopening plan despite words of caution over the weekend from public health experts. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, both warned that states rolling back restrictions could face a virus resurgence.

Senate confirms Cardona as Biden’s education secretary</h2>
                <p>
The Senate voted Monday to confirm Miguel Cardona as education secretary, clearing his way to lead President Biden’s effort to reopen the nation’s schools amid the coronavirus pandemic. Cardona, a former public school teacher who went on to become Connecticut’s education chief, was approved on a 64-33 vote.He takes charge of the Education Department amid mounting tension between Americans who believe students can safely return to the classroom now, and others who say the risks are still too great.

Although his position carries limited authority to force schools to reopen, Cardona will be asked to play a central role in achieving Biden’s goal to have a majority of elementary schools open five days a week within his first 100 days. He will be tasked with guiding schools through the reopening process, and sharing best practices on how to teach during a pandemic.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month released a road map for getting students back into classrooms safely. The agency said masks, social distancing and other strategies should be used, but vaccination of teachers was not a prerequisite for reopening.

Cardona, who gained attention for his efforts to reopen schools in Connecticut, has vowed to make it his top priority to reopen schools. At his Senate confirmation hearing last month, he said there are “great examples throughout our country of schools that have been able to reopen safely.”

The debate has become a political firestorm for Biden, who is caught between competing interests as he aims to get students into the classroom without provoking the powerful teachers unions that helped put him in the White House. He says his goal of returning students to the classroom is possible if Congress approves his relief plan, which includes $130 billion for the nation’s schools.
